## Introduction

The FakeNewsDetectionModel aims to combat the growing problem of misinformation by detecting fake news using machine learning. The model analyzes text data from news articles and classifies them as genuine or fake using various NLP and supervised learning algorithms. This project explores data preprocessing, feature extraction, and different classification models to achieve high accuracy.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FakeNewsDetectionModel.git
   cd FakeNewsDetectionModel
   ```
2. **Install required libraries:**

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
  python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # On Windows, use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
  jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the FakeNewsDetection.ipynb notebook to run the project.


## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset:** Ensure you have a labeled dataset with news articles marked as fake or real (e.g., the Kaggle Fake News dataset). Load this dataset into the notebook.
2. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the cells in sequence to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## Key Steps in the Notebook:
* **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data cleaning, text normalization, stopwords removal, tokenization, and stemming/lemmatization.
* **Feature Extraction:** Using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Count Vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
* **Model Training:** Implement various supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
* **Comparison:** Compare different models to identify the best performer based on evaluation metrics.
